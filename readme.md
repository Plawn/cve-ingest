# Adapted Ingester of cve-search

Re-implememented to use Deno instead of python for cleaner developpment

Should be compatible with cve-search data format.

Uses async generators in order to maximise the speed of the app while
maintaining a clean implementation.

There is no use of redis here

## ?

-> Why do we want to do chunks of one month ?

> That is easier to work with, and if a chunk fails that is easier to retry a
> smaller portion

## TODO

- [x] Implement the cpe match data feed
- [x] Clean the implementation
- [x] Implement differential update using the last date
- [ ] move to chain instead of pipe and using "on" / implem backpressure
