# Adapted Ingester of cve-search

Re-implememented to use Deno instead of python for cleaner developpment

Should be compatible with cve-search data format.

Uses async generators in order to maximise the speed of the app while
maintaining a clean implementation.

There is no use of redis here

## Implemented

For now only the cve api is implemented and the only thing that this script do
is putting the data from NVD in the mongo

## TODO

- [ ] Implement the cpe match data feed
- [ ] Clean the implementation
- [ ] Implement differential update using the last date
